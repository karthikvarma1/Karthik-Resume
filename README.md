## 🗞 WORK DONE

**The effect of lockdown and it's impact on Air Quality (2020)** <br>

The data for this project were accumulated from multiple sources and used some visualization techniques for a better understanding of the situation. The air quality of daily data is analyzed for 15 European countries and split into pre-lockdown and duringlockdown for comparison. The regression and Arima models were used in this project. <br>


**Human Face Emotion Recognition System (2020)** <br>

The dataset contains grey-scale images of human faces to predict
the emotions and used Conventional Machine Learning and Deep
Learning approaches. The aim is to build a high performing system
and scored a good place at Kaggle in class competition.


**Report on “Detect Drive off – An Automated Detection, Payment, and Reporting System.” (2021)** <br>

The IoT devices will be used to detect the drive-off and tires to do the payment for first time and happening many times or the person is suspicious then automatically the system will put them in the blocklist and reports to the police with some useful information.
